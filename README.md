- 👋 Hi, I’m @rutbut369
- 👀 I’m interested in truth. God is love. Jesus Christ is Lord.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Android Studio to build applications, Websites (HTML, CSS, js, etc), Python (Anaconda/Conda), and a few others.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that glorify God or focus on building solutions in line with truth and justice.
- 📫 How to reach me: rutbut_adguard2428@proton.me
- 😄 Pronouns: I am a man created by God, born again with the Holy Ghost.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am only as smart as I need to be. However, I know nothing.
