Your code will work for basic use, but there are a few areas that could be optimized for better performance or flexibility:

1. Scripture Heuristic: The function is_scripture uses a limited set of keywords that may not cover a wide range of scripture texts across different religious traditions. You may want to expand or customize the list depending on the specific context you're working with.


2. Sentence Splitting: Using re.split(r'(?<=[.!?]) +', text) is a reasonable approach, but it assumes that all sentences end with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. Some scriptures (like the Bible) may not follow this structure exactly. For example, verses are often shorter and might not use those punctuation marks.


3. Handling Text Size: If you expect larger scripture texts, you could implement some form of batching or progress tracking to let users know how far along the processing is.



Suggested Changes

Here are a few improvements you might consider:

1. Expand the keyword list to better match scripture-like text from various sources (this depends on your domain).


2. Add handling for punctuation-less scripture references (like biblical verses).


3. Return or log more structured information like verse numbers or references if available.



Example of how you might handle large text processing:

def parse_principles_of_love(text, batch_size=100):
    keywords = ['love', 'compassion', 'kindness', 'forgiveness', 'patience', 'humility']
    
    if not is_scripture(text):
        print("Warning: The input text does not appear to be scripture. Please enter scripture text.")
        return []

    sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?]) +', text)
    love_principles = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(sentences), batch_size):
        batch = sentences[i:i+batch_size]
        love_principles.extend([s for s in batch if any(keyword in s.lower() for keyword in keywords)])
        
        # Progress feedback
        print(f"Processed {i + batch_size} of {len(sentences)} sentences.")
    
    return love_principles
